The microstructure includes the shape, size, and arrangement of stone units, which vary based on geographic, temporal, and material factors. Current building codes cannot fully account for this variability, and experimental studies are costly and impractical due to the diversity of masonry typologies. Numerical studies offer a solution, but creating realistic microstructures for modeling irregular stone masonry is complex and time-consuming. As a result, simplified microstructures are often used in simulations, which fail to capture the complexities of irregular masonry walls. To address this challenge, we have developed a 3D masonry microstructures database ready to use in numerical simulations. To enhance accessibility and usability, this project aims to create a web-based platform hosting this curated database of 3D microstructures and their geometric indices. The proposed web-based platform will also feature a tool for evaluating masonry quality using the Masonry Quality Index (MQI) from 2D images, promoting the preservation of historic structures and sustainable construction practices. Additionally, the platform will enable researchers to contribute and document new 3D microstructures, fostering collaboration and advancing numerical research on stone masonry."

To do this, we need to work jointly with riverine and marine data, accounting for their temporal and spatial distribution. However, each of these systems have different data and metadata reporting strategies that need to be accounted for, which complicates their joint application. Efforts have been made to compile data from each of these systems into independent databases, but no attempt has yet been done to create a joint database of data of both of these systems while accounting for their different metadata. Hence, this project aims to bring together riverine and marine data into one database to easily query the data between both systems through the River to Ocean Geodatabase for Education and Research (ROGER). This database will be displayed in an interactive web-interface that queries riverine and/or marine data depending on the user’s requirements through a REST API. Harnessing the advanced geographical functions of PostgreSQL, the REST API will include functions that allow users to geospatially integrate riverine and marine data. This new database will provide a crucial step forward in the understanding of the carbon cycle along the land-ocean continuum, while ensuring that the data complies with best Open Research Data practices."
https://open-research-data-portal.ch/projects/development-of-standardized-respiratory-open-access-research/,Development of standardized Respiratory Open Access Research,Contribute,EPFL,Medical data,Life sciences,"Dan, Jonathan","Chronic cough is a common condition globally. While efforts are being made to develop wearables to detect and quantify cough events automatically, such monitoring devices have not yet been incorporated into routine clinical practice due to a lack of consistency in their validation, resulting in slow progress and a lack of trust in reported results. We have identified three main reasons for this heterogeneity: 1) the clinical definition of different cough events and especially the delimitation of their beginning/end lacks standardization, 2) the data used is typically private and imbalanced with inadequate labelling as a result of the previous point, and 3) methodologies to assess the accuracy of event detection are different between research groups and often inappropriate. This proposal builds on ORD datasets, community guidelines, and standards to propose a unified framework for validating cough event detection algorithms. The main objective is the development of standards that will unify the workflow for validating respiratory event detection algorithms to ensure data adheres the principles of Findable, Accessible, Interpretable, and Reusable data. This will be distributed through a website, serving as a central hub and reference for standardizing clinical definitions and methodologies, leading to a future benchmarking platform for respiratory event detection algorithms."
https://open-research-data-portal.ch/projects/an-ord-framework-for-synthetic-mobility-data/,An ORD framework for synthetic mobility data,Contribute,ETH Zurich,Mobility data,Urban studies,"Balac, Milos","The eqasim pipeline, developed at ETH, is an ORD tool for generating synthetic travel demand datasets. However, its current implementation in Switzerland has several limitations. The Swiss implementation relies on non-open data from the Swiss Federal Office of Statistics, which complicates data sharing and slows research due to the need for lengthy data privacy agreements. This limits the speed of innovation and collaboration among researchers. Additionally, each new application of eqasim requires duplicating and modifying the codebase to incorporate new datasets, resulting in fragmented approaches. This project aims to overcome these limitations by enhancing the standardization of the eqasim framework, improving the ease of data exchange, and enabling better control over algorithms and data extraction. By addressing these issues, the project will streamline data sharing and accelerate research, ultimately increasing the impact of eqasim in Switzerland and beyond."

UT&C is a widely used urban climate model with a detailed vegetation scheme, thus being the perfect tool to inform urban greening strategies in cities around the world. However, the current code is written in a proprietary language and it is computationally heavy. By translating the UT&C code into Python and making it more open, FAIR, and user-friendly, this project will open up to new scientific opportunities (e.g., city-scale simulations, model coupling), facilitate a community-based development, and increase its accessibility to the broader urban climate and urban planning communities."

Datalakes (DL) is a web-based open access data platform that provides, for LP, seven datasets in real-time. We have identified two challenges that could limit the FAIR approach to the data. This project aims at addressing them by: a) enhancing the robustness of the LP data transfer pipelines and b) enhancing DL data quality by prototyping a collaborative QA/QC Solution. The first objective is to strengthen the LP data pipeline by decoupling the data gathering from the data processing functions. The resulting simplified distribution of responsibilities will facilitate long-term maintenance and secure the system's long-term reliability. The second objective aims at designing a prototype of a collaborative QA/QC tool. For this, we will collaborate closely with the LP community, by organising two workshops and a QA/QC hackathon. The developed prototype will allow domain experts to efficiently assess and flag data quality issues, in order to improve accuracy and reliability of sensor data. This project will involve the operational LP team, the DL core developers, and research software engineers from ENAC-IT4R. The proposed improvements will help to strategically maintain and elevate LP's high scientific impacts in the long-term. DL will continue to guide the lake research community towards embracing Open Research Data practices."

In agreement with NASA- JPL, ARES will make all data produced by AVIRIS-4 publicly available and is building an environment of open tools to make the processing of this data accessible, interoperable and reproducible, in line with FAIR principles. During our previous ORD-Contribute project, OGAIS, we developed an open tool which can be used to label point correspondences in AIS images by hand. This tool enables the airborne remote sensing community to obtain ground truth “tie-points” for evaluating the quality of the scene reconstruction and/or improving the image geo-referencing accuracy. After the first flights of AVIRIS-4 during the spring-summer this year, a clear need emerged for the mission at high resolution (0.3 – 1 m/pixel) to obtain point correspondence labels without human intervention in order to ii) improve the conventional (direct) georeferencing, ii) automate the quality assessment on all current and future missions featuring more than couple flight-lines (>0.5 TB / mission). This project therefore proposes to support ARES ORD practices by providing tools to automate the detection of tie-points as spatial constraints in overlapping AVIRIS-4 images, and integrate them in EPFL’s open, on-line georeferencing service ODYN to maximise findability."

Despite the critical value of ORD in fostering scalable applications, significant challenges persist, including fragmented data storage, heterogeneity in standards, and inadequate metadata documentation, which complicates data contextualization and accessibility. This project, NEST-Bot, aims to address these challenges by enhancing data discoverability through an automated integration layer that populates a knowledge graph. NEST-Bot will train a LLM to serve as an intuitive interface for stakeholders-ranging from academic researchers and data scientists to HVAC engineers, architects, and automation experts-to access NEST-related data. A key aspect of the project involves the automatic generation of the integration layer from existing repositories, allowing the LLM to retrieve complex, heterogeneous datasets via natural language queries. This innovative approach aims to streamline data retrieval, enhance data quality, reduce redundancies, and make ORD practices more scalable and beneficial to the building sector. By linking and organizing diverse repositories, NEST-Bot will enable seamless interaction with complex datasets, establishing new standards for data integration and ORD in building automation and research."

We built infrastructure and communication channels, taught 100 WASH professionals the basics of data science, developed a workflow to publish WASH data following FAIR data principles, and mobilized those in the sector who were interested in joining our vision and mission. Our next step is establishing a data stewardship network, actively working with strategic partners in Malawi and South Africa by placing a fully-funded data steward within a research institute and a non-governmental organization. A newly developed 12-module ""data stewardship for openwashdata'' training programme will develop data management strategies and help our partners to institutionalize ORD practices long-term within their organizations. We will also further invest in the openwashdata publishing arm of the community by increasing the FAIRness of our data, critically analyzing how to better address the details of all four components of FAIR: Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability. We will also set up a governance structure and sounding board to ensure the long-term sustainability of the community. Through our activities and active open communications channels, we expect to create a demand for data stewardship in the WASH sector, assess their role and define a profile for data stewards more generally."

Our goal is twofold: develop prototype Open Research Data (ORD) tools with the Swiss Data Science Center and assess their effectiveness with the international urban drainage community. We will explore if RENKU can serve as a comprehensive platform for this, given its features like collaborative workflow management, version control, and integration with data science tools, promoting reproducibility, and efficient collaboration among researchers. Planned use cases include i) individual researchers sharing results, ii) benchmarking rainfall-runoff models in our department, iii) and distributed groups providing pre-processed datasets with full provenance information. We will start by enhancing the FAIRness of a 20-year-old dataset on sewer mixing. Additionally, we will evaluate different EPA-SWMM model implementations and engage the international urban drainage community in ORD practices.

The Sequence Read Archive (SRA) exemplifies the scale of available data, housing over 40 Petabases. However, the current indexing methods, which rely on metadata rather than full-text searches, significantly limit the potential for research and discovery. The Biomedical Informatics lab at ETH Zürich has developed a computational framework capable of indexing whole sequence repositories on a petabyte scale, compressing data significantly while maintaining search efficiency. This framework, embodied in the MetaGraph software platform, represents a major technological advancement, enabling precise, large-scale genomic data analysis. The lab has applied this framework to over 4 PB of raw sequencing data, freely sharing the generated indexes to promote open research. The proposal aims to establish MetaGraph as a leading open research data tool and to build a vibrant user community around it, enhancing accessibility and utility of genomic data.

This challenge comes to the fore when conducting transdisciplinary (Td) research, where new forms of engagement between science and society co-produce problem framings and project outputs. In this context, questions of who processes and stores data are increasingly important. Td research makes frequent use of qualitative methods, especially interviews and workshops. Sharing of this data could allow for improved learning between Td processes and increase engagement between science and society. How might this data be shared according to FAIR principles? What are appropriate protocols for determining what data to share and how to navigate the ethical issues of research participant protection and the benefits of sharing qualitative data?

Furthermore, existing model and data repositories are not designed to host hybrid models which contain code, ML models, and associated training data. To address these challenges, FRAME will collaboratively design, implement, and test a standardised FAIR protocol tailored for hydrological hybrid models. The protocol will consist of coding standards for interoperability between different model components, a unified metadata specification accounting for different types of physics and ML-based models, and a python package leveraging existing model and data repositories widely used in the hydrology (HydroShare) and ML (DLHub) communities to share and retrieve hybrid models. To ensure wider and long-term impact of the project beyond its lifetime, the developed protocol will be actively used and improved by participating groups in the ETH Domain and Europe and will ultimately be transitioned to a community-driven protocol, inviting participation from the wider scientific community."

MOTEL tackles this problem by applying Open Research Data (ORD) practices to technology-related data. The project aims to build an open-access data-base from unpublished data that is actively developed and used for internal model development by the Urban Energy Systems Lab (UESL) at Empa. This database will be supplemented with metadata to improve accessibil-ity, interoperability, and transparency of the underlying parameters when used in ESM studies. To achieve interoperability, we will identify and adhere to established ontologies. By connecting each parameter to a mathematically formulated model, we aim to develop a standardized methodology that explicitly defines each parameter, reducing the need for manual preprocessing and expert knowledge when using the data for ESM studies. The database will be published and maintained on the lab's existing infrastructure. In addition, we will establish a reproducible workflow demonstrating how the structured, ORD-compliant data can be seamlessly integrated into ESM tools. This will be achieved through a Python-based model builder that connects to the database and interfaces with our optimization-based ESM platform, ehubX."

This approach enhances our understanding of astronomical phenomena. The challenge lies in managing the diverse data sets, typically available as ORD, used in multi-messenger data analysis. Reproducibility and traceability of results to raw observational data are essential for implementing the ""Findable-Accessible-Interoperable-Reusable"" (FAIR) principle. The project offers a solution: cloud-based ORD data analysis services (ORDAS) to ensure result reproducibility and ORD reusability. These services will be developed for two next-generation facilities, the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) and Square Kilometre Array (SKA). The power of ORDAS will be showcased through a Multi-Messenger Online Data Analysis (MMODA) platform, engaging the multi-messenger astronomy community in ORD practices for transient multi-messenger astronomical source studies requiring on-the-fly analysis of multi-messenger ORD."

Metadata standards for interoperability between electronic lab notebooks (ELNs)/lab information management systems (LIMSs) and workflow management systems (WFMSs) will be developed in the field of Materials Science, and combined with ontological semantic annotations. Best practices for integrating ORD into the research process will be collected, designed, and disseminated. Pilot use cases (focusing in particular on microscopies, spectroscopies, and battery research) that are applicable broadly to Materials Science research will demonstrate the deliverables. Open platforms like openBIS and AiiDA+AiiDAlab will be enhanced to meet FAIR requirements. These advancements will enable seamless interoperability between ELN/LIMS and WFMS. The ultimate goal of the project is to contribute to autonomous laboratories, where AI-driven simulations and robotic experiments expedite materials discovery and characterization.See the website:https://ord-premise.org/"

Cryo-EM has revolutionized protein structure determination, while materials science has seen a surge in possibilities, including 4D STEM data. This has led to increased data volumes and computational needs. OpenEM will extend PSI’s SciCat Data Catalog to provide open and FAIR access to EM data Swiss-wide. It aims to standardize data and metadata collection, streamline acquisition, facilitate data sharing, automate deposition in international ORD repositories, offer user training, and establish a sustainable structure beyond the project’s closure. A parallel initiative through the swissuniversities CHORD program funds the participation of partners outside the ETH domain. OpenEM complements the “EM frontiers” initiative to advance electron microscopy technology in Switzerland, included in the Swiss Roadmap for Research Infrastructures 2023.See the website:https://swissopenem.github.io/"

These spectra are fundamental for in-depth protein analysis but remain largely inaccessible. The NMRprime initiative seeks to establish a FAIR-compliant database, integrating with the Protein Data Bank (PDB) and Biological Magnetic Resonance Bank (BMRB). NMRprime will facilitate spectrum uploads, automated annotation via machine learning, search capabilities, and open data access. The goal, in collaboration with PDB, BMRB, and journals, is to mandate NMR spectra deposition for bio-NMR projects, paralleling protein structure deposition in thePDBas is well-established for other methods in structural biology such as X-ray crystallography. NMRprime's expertise in bio-NMR and automated spectral analysis makes it the ideal candidate for this mission."
